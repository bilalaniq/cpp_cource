// --------------------------------------------assembly language ---------------------------------
/*
 Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely tied to the 
 architecture of a specific computer's hardware.

The extension for an assembly language file can vary depending on the specific assembler being used or personal preference. However, 
some common extensions for assembly language files include:

1. `.asm`: This is a widely used extension for assembly language source files.
2. `.s`: Another common extension, particularly in Unix-like systems.
3. `.asmx`: This extension is sometimes used to indicate extended assembly files.

These are just a few examples, and the choice of extension may vary depending on the conventions of the development environment or 
the preferences of the programmer.


It provides a human-readable representation of machine code instructions, which are the basic operations understood 
by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).*/

// ----------------------------------registers-------------------------------
/*
Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU (Central Processing Unit) of a computer. 
They are used to store data temporarily during the execution of a program. Registers are the fastest type of 
memory in a computer system because they are located directly within the CPU and can be accessed
much more quickly than main memory (RAM).

size also depend upon the architechture of the cpu 
the 32 bit machines has 32 bit registers and 64 bit machines has 64 bit registers

backword compatibility is maintained by allowing access to subset of registers so 32 bit code still runs 
on 64 bit machines as because the processor can treat half of the 64 bit register though it was a 32 bit 
register

// -----------------------------stack---------------------------------------
/* The stack is a region of memory in a computer's RAM that is used for temporary storage of data 
during program execution.
it operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis
"Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) is a principle that describes the behavior of a stack data structure
In a LIFO system, the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed

there are few terms used for stack

>> Pushing: When you add an item to the stack 
items are always pushed on the top 
>> Popping: When you remove an item from the stack 
items are always poped from the top

>> stackpointer: 
The stack pointer is a special register or memory location within a computer's CPU  that keeps 
track of the top of the stack in memory. It stores the memory address of the most recently pushed 
items onto the stack or the next available space for a new item to be pushed.

// ---------------------------------some common registers and there uses --------------------------------
/*
>>eax (Accumulator Register): Used for arithmetic operations, storing function 
return values and passing arguments.Some instructions, like mul (multiply) and div (divide)
implicitly use eax as one of their operands or to store the result.

>>ebx (Base Register): Often used as a pointer to data in memory, particularly 
for accessing arrays or structures.

>>ecx (Count Register): Frequently used as a loop counter in iterative operations or 
for storing temporary data.

>>edx (Data Register): Similar to eax, used for arithmetic and logical operations.

>>esi (Source Index Register): Commonly used for string and memory operations
typically holding the source address.

>>edi (Destination Index Register): Commonly used for string and memory operations
typically holding the destination address.

>>ebp (Base Pointer Register): Often used as a frame pointer for accessing 
function parameters and local variables on the stack.

>>esp (Stack Pointer Register): Points to the top of the stack and is involved in managing 
the stack, especially during function calls and returns.

>>eip (Instruction Pointer Register): Holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.

>>Flags Register (EFLAGS): Contains status flags indicating the outcome 
of arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.

// --------------------------------------------flags--------------------------------------------
// some common flags
//these flags are set accordig to the jump condition provided
/*
>>>>>>>>>Zero Flag (ZF):it is used for both arithmatic oprations and coparission and logical opratoins(AND ,OR ,XOR)
Set if the result of the operation is zero. Cleared if the result is non-zero.(for add ,sub , mul,div)
the Zero Flag is set if the operands are equal.


>>>>>>>>Sign Flag (SF): Set if the most significant bit (the sign bit) of the result is set (i.e., if the result is negative).
Cleared if the result is positive.

>>>>>>>>Carry Flag (CF): Set if there is a carry-out from the most significant bit during addition or a borrow during subtraction.
Used for unsigned arithmetic.

>>>>>>>Overflow Flag (OF): Set if the signed result is too large (positive overflow) or too small (negative overflow) to be represented in the destination.
Used for signed arithmetic.

>>>>>>>Parity Flag (PF): Set if the least significant byte of the result contains an even number of 1 bits.
Used for error checking.

>>>>>>>Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF): Used for binary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic.
Set if there is a carry-out from or borrow into bit 3 to bit 4 during addition or subtraction operations.
For example, if performing a BCD addition results in a carry from bit 3 to bit 4, AF is set.

// ---------------------------------common comands of assemblly language---------------------------
/*
>>>>>>>>>>>>> push: is used to push a value onto the stack
example = push eax
we are pushing the value of the eax on the stack

>>>>>>>>>>>> Pop: is used to remove an item from the stack 
example = pop eax
we are poping the value of eax from the stack

>>>>>>>>>>>> call : used to call a function
example = call function_name (adress_of_function)
it will simply call the function

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> mov : it is used to move the digit to a register
example = mov eax,100    
here we are moving 100 into eax register

>>>>>>>>>>>sub : it is used to substraction
example = sub eax,10
here i am substracting the 100 which is store in eax as from the above mov example with 10
it will alter the value of ebx so the value of ebx will become 90

>>>>>>>>>>>>> add : it is used to add two registers
example= add eax,10 
now the value of eax will become 100

>>>>>>>>>>> mul : multiplication
example = 
mov eax, 10   ; Load eax with 10
mov ebx, 2    ; Load ebx with 2
mul ebx       ; this will multiply ebx with eax and result will be stored in eax

-----------Some instructions, like mul (multiply) and div (divide)implicitly 
-----------use eax as one of their operands or to store the result.

>>>>>>>>>>>> div : division
example = 
mov eax, 10   ; Load eax with 10
mov ebx, 2    ; Load ebx with 2
div ebx 
; After execution, eax will contain the quotient (10 รท 2 = 5)
; and edx will contain the remainder (10 % 2 = 0)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> [pointer]
mov dword ptr [b],2
b acts as a pointer (but are not pointers) because it holds a memory address
[ ]it indicates that you are referencing the memory location where 
 the value of the variable or register is stored.


cmp : used to compare values of two registers
syntax = cmp destination, source
example = cmp eax,10
this will compare the 10 with the value inside the eax
cmp does not store the result of the comparison anywhere; it only updates the flags.


>>>>>>>>>>>>> jmp : stand for jump it is used in conditions
forexample = take a if condition 
if(a == 1)
{
    cout << a <<endl;
}else
{
    cout << b <<endl;
}
now here if a is not equal to 1 then the compiler will jump to else condition
-------------------------------jump conditions----------------------------------------------
when we compare two registers it than set flags according to the given conditions which are then 
used by the jump condition to weather jump or not

>>>>>>je (jump if Equal) : 
example = 
cmp eax, ebx   ; Compare the values in EAX and EBX
je  [adress] ; Jump to adress and execute the adressed code if EAX is equal to EBX

>>>>>>jne (Jump if Not Equal): 
example = 
cmp eax, ebx    ; Compare the values in EAX and EBX
jne  [adresss] ; Jump to given adress if EAX is not equal to EBX

>>>>>> jg (Jump if Greater) : 
example = 
cmp eax, ebx   ; Compare the values in EAX and EBX
jg  [adress] ; Jump to given adress if EAX is greater than EBX

>>>>>>>jl ("jump if less than")
example = 
cmp eax, ebx    ; Compare the values in EAX and EBX
jl  [adress] ; Jump to given adress if EAX is less than EBX

>>>>>>>jle (Jump if Less Than or Equal): 

>>>>>>>jge (Jump if Greater Than or Equal):

>>>>>>>jb (Jump if Below) :

>>>>>>>ja (Jump if Above): 

>>>>>>>jbe (Jump if Below or Equal):

>>>>>>>jae (Jump if Above or Equal):
