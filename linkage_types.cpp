/*
The linkage specifier extern "C" in C++ is primarily used to indicate that the function should use C-style linkage. However, it's important to note that the concept of linkage itself primarily revolves around whether symbols (functions, variables, etc.) can be accessed from other translation units (source files).

In addition to the external, internal, and no linkage types mentioned earlier, there's another type of linkage known as "language linkage." Language linkage specifies how the names of entities declared in one language are treated when referred to from another language.

Here are some additional details:

Language Linkage:
C and C++ can interoperate, but they have different name mangling conventions. C++ supports features like function overloading and namespaces, which affect how names are represented in object code. When you declare a function with extern "C", you're specifying that it should use C-style linkage, meaning that the function name will not undergo C++ name mangling.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
extern "C" {
    // Function declarations here...
}
Default Linkage:
If no linkage specifier is provided, functions and variables declared at file scope have external linkage by default in C++. This means they can be accessed from other translation units.
Functions and variables declared within a namespace have internal linkage by default.
Local variables declared within a function have no linkage.
Unnamed Namespace:
An unnamed namespace is a C++ feature that provides internal linkage to its members within the translation unit where it's defined. It's a way to create symbols with internal linkage without using the static keyword.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
namespace {
    // Internal linkage symbols here...
}
These are the primary types and concepts related to linkage in C and C++. Understanding them is essential for managing symbol visibility and avoiding name conflicts in large projects.
