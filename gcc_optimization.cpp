/*
GCC optimization refers to the various techniques and algorithms employed by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to improve 
the performance, size, and efficiency of the compiled code. When you compile a program using GCC, you can specify optimization 
levels using the `-O` flag followed by a number (0 to 3) or specific optimization options.

>>>>>>>>> optimization:
Optimization, in the context of programming and compilation, refers to the process of improving the performance, size, or 
other characteristics of a program by making it execute more efficiently. Optimization techniques aim to reduce the resource 
consumption (such as CPU time, memory usage, or energy consumption) of a program while still achieving the desired functionality.


Here are the optimization levels and their meanings:

- `-O0`: No optimization. This level is useful for debugging, as it generates code that is easy to debug but might be less efficient.
- `-O1`: Basic optimizations. This level enables most common optimizations that don't significantly increase compilation time. 
It includes optimizations like instruction scheduling, common subexpression elimination, and basic register allocation.
- `-O2`: Moderate optimizations. This level enables more aggressive optimizations, which might result in longer compilation times 
but generally produce faster code. It includes all optimizations from `-O1` plus additional optimizations like loop unrolling and 
inlining of functions.
- `-O3`: Aggressive optimizations. This level enables even more aggressive optimizations, which can significantly improve performance 
but might also increase code size and compilation time. It includes all optimizations from `-O2` plus additional optimizations like 
automatic vectorization and function cloning.

In addition to these levels, GCC provides numerous individual optimization options that you can enable or disable separately according 
to your specific requirements. These options allow you to fine-tune the optimization process based on the characteristics of your code, 
the target architecture, and your performance goals.

By choosing an appropriate optimization level or combination of optimization options, you can achieve better performance, reduced code 
size, and improved efficiency for your compiled programs. However, it's essential to balance optimization with factors like code 
readability, debugging ease, and compatibility across different platforms.
