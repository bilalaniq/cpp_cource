example:
class c1

note that here copy constructor is being called because the class c2 is being created at the same line

example:
class c1;
class c2;
c2 = c1;
note that here the assignment oprator is being used because the c2 was existing before

copy constructor can also be called 
class c1;
classc c2(c1);
here the copy constructor is being called

/*
> note that if you donot provide an assignment oprator the compiler will create a default assinment oprator but it is recumended 
to create an overloaded assignment oprator as the default opprator may not work according to your need 

> note that just like assgnment oprator the compiler also provides a copy constructor if there is no copy constructor provided by the 
programmer but it is recumended to create a copy constructor as the default constructor may not over come you need and will not copy the
