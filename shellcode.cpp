// --------------------------------shellcode-----------------------------------
/*
Shellcode refers to a small piece of code, typically written in assembly language, that is used to perform a specific task 
within the context of a software exploit
Shellcode is designed to be injected into a target process's memory, often by exploiting a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow 
or a code injection vulnerability. Once injected, the shellcode is executed within the context of the target process, allowing 
the attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such as gaining remote access to the system, escalating privileges, or 
executing arbitrary code.
Shellcode is typically highly optimized and written in low-level languages like assembly language to ensure it's compact, 
efficient, and capable of bypassing security mechanisms. It often needs to be tailored to the specific architecture and operating 
system of the target system to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.

it is writen in assembly language and then is converted into hexadecimal opcode
