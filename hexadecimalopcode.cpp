// -----------------------------------hexadecimal opcode----------------------------- 
/*
Hexadecimal opcodes, also known as machine code or opcode sequences, are representations of computer instructions in hexadecimal 
format. In computing, machine code is the lowest level of instructions that a computer can execute directly. Each instruction in 
machine code corresponds to a specific operation that the CPU can perform, such as arithmetic, logic, or data manipulation.

Here's a breakdown of hexadecimal opcodes:

Representation: Hexadecimal (base-16) notation is used to represent machine code instructions. Each hexadecimal digit represents 
four binary digits (bits), allowing for compact representation of binary data.
Instructions: Each opcode corresponds to a specific machine instruction that the CPU understands and executes. These instructions 
can include operations like arithmetic (addition, subtraction), logic (AND, OR, NOT), data movement (load, store), control flow 
(branching, jumping), and more.
Format: The format of machine code instructions varies depending on the CPU architecture and instruction set. Each instruction 
typically consists of an opcode (operation code) that specifies the operation to be performed and may also include additional 
operands or parameters that provide further information to the CPU.
Example: Here's an example of a simple machine code instruction represented in hexadecimal:
Copy code
8B C3
In this example, 8B represents the opcode for a specific operation (e.g., move data), and C3 represents additional information or 
operands for the operation.
Usage: Hexadecimal opcodes are used in various contexts, including low-level programming, reverse engineering, and exploit development. 
They are often encountered when analyzing binary executables, disassembling code, or debugging programs at the machine code level.
In summary, hexadecimal opcodes are representations of machine code instructions in hexadecimal format. They encode the operations 
that a CPU can perform and are used in low-level programming and analysis of binary executables.
