GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection." It's a suite of programming language compilers developed by the GNU Project. GCC is 
one of the most widely used compiler collections in the world, and it supports several programming languages, including C, C++, 
Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and others.

Here are some key points about GCC:

1. **Open Source**: GCC is free and open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means that 
you can freely use, modify, and distribute it.

2. **Cross-Platform**: GCC is available on various platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and others. It can compile code for 
different target architectures, making it suitable for developing software for a wide range of systems.

3. **Language Support**: GCC supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different development needs. It's 
commonly used for compiling C and C++ programs but also supports other languages like Fortran, Ada, and Objective-C.

4. **Optimizations**: GCC provides a wide range of optimization options to improve the performance of compiled code. These optimizations 
can be specified using command-line options or pragma directives in the source code.

5. **Extensions**: GCC supports various language extensions and features that go beyond the standard language specifications. 
These extensions can provide additional functionality or compatibility with specific platforms.

6. **Modular Architecture**: GCC is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to add support for new languages or 
target architectures through plugins or custom front ends.

Overall, GCC is a powerful and versatile compiler collection widely used by developers for compiling code in various programming 
languages and targeting different platforms and architectures.
