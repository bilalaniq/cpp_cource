before knowing dllimport and dllexport you need to know about dill(dynamic lik library)
click here to learn about dll

/*
also you need to learn about __declspec
is a Microsoft-specific extension that allows you to specify various attributes for symbols
(functions, variables, and classes) when compiling code with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

__declspec(dllexport)  : 
When you declare a function or class as __declspec(dllexport) in the source code of a DLL, it tells the compiler 
to export the symbol so that it can be accessed by code outside the DLL.

__declspec(dllimport)  : 
when you declare a function or class as __declspec(dllimport) in the source code of an application that uses the DLL, 
it tells the compiler to import the symbol from the DLL.

heres an simple eaxample in which i have created one header file and cpp file in cpp in which i have defined macros 
and also the defination of the fnctuion

in the main file i have initilized the functions 
and then comes the c# file in which i will use the function

the cpp file and the header file is converted into dll file
wich later on the c# file will use

extern "C" {                                       This is a linkage specification in C++. It instructs 
    ADDER_API int AddNumbers(int a, int b);        the compiler to use C-style linkage for the function AddNumbers.
}                                                  C-style linkage means that the function will have the same name 
                                                   and calling convention as it would if it were declared in a C source file

/*
C++ supports function overloading, name mangling, and other features that can change the function's name and behavior 
when compiled. Using extern "C" ensures that the function's name and calling convention are preserved, making it compatible
with code written in C and other languages.

/*
#define ADDER_API __declspec(dllexport):
If ADDER_EXPORTS is defined, this line defines the ADDER_API macro as __declspec(dllexport).
__declspec(dllexport) is a Microsoft-specific keyword that instructs the compiler to export symbols from the DLL. Symbols
 marked with dllexport are made available for use by other modules (executable files or other DLLs) that link against the DLL.
 If ADDER_EXPORTS is not defined (i.e., when using the DLL in another project), the code in the else block is executed.
 In this case, the ADDER_API macro is defined as __declspec(dllimport).
 __declspec(dllimport) is used to declare that a symbol is imported from a DLL. It tells the compiler that the symbol is
  defined in another module (the DLL) and should be imported into the current module (the executable or another DLL).
