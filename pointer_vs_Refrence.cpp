Dereference the pointer by using (*)                                 *(an alias is another name for the same thing)
> Can be reassigned to point to different objects.                   *  > no derefrencing is required as references are aliases.
> Requires manual memory management (allocation and deallocation)    *  > Can not be reassigned to point to different objects 
> pointer can point to different objects at different times          *  > No memory management needed, automatically follows

//Returning a reference to such objects can lead to undefined behavior. so here you should retur value not refrence or a pointer
