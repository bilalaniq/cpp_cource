/*
Late binding, also known as dynamic dispatch, is a mechanism used in object-oriented programming languages to determine the
appropriate method or function to invoke at runtime. It allows for polymorphism, where different classes can define methods 
with the same name but different implementations, and the correct method is selected based on the actual type of the object being 
referred to.

Here's how late binding works:

1. **Virtual Functions:**
   Late binding is typically associated with virtual functions (or methods). 
   When a function is declared as virtual in a base class, it signifies that derived 
   classes can override (redefine) that function with their own implementations.

2. **Base Class Pointers or References:**
   Late binding occurs when you call a virtual function through a base class pointer or 
   reference that points to an object of a derived class. At compile time, the compiler 
   knows the type of the pointer/reference (i.e., the base class type), but it doesn't 
   know the actual type of the object it points to.

3. **Runtime Resolution:**
   During program execution (runtime), when a virtual function is called through a base class
    pointer/reference, the actual implementation of the function to be executed is determined 
    dynamically based on the type of the object being referred to. This is where late binding 
    comes into play.

4. **Dynamic Dispatch:**
   Late binding involves dynamic dispatch, which is the process of determining the appropriate
    function to call at runtime. The correct function implementation (either from the base class 
    or one of its derived classes) is selected dynamically based on the runtime type of the object.

Late binding enables polymorphic behavior in object-oriented programs, allowing for flexible
 and extensible designs where the behavior of objects can vary based on their runtime type. 
 It's a fundamental concept in languages that support inheritance, virtual functions, and
  polymorphism, such as C++ and Java.
