/*
---------------------why stack is faster then heap 
the reason behind this is that due to the following reasons 

>>>>>>>>>Memory Allocation:

---------Stack: Memory allocation and deallocation on the stack are very fast because it's a simple, Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.
When a function is called, a block of memory is reserved on the stack for local variables. When the function returns, the memory
is automatically reclaimed. This push and pop mechanism is straightforward and requires minimal bookkeeping.
---------Heap: The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., when using malloc in C or new in C++). Allocating and freeing
memory on the heap involves more complex management. The heap requires searching for a free block of memory of the appropriate size
and maintaining metadata about allocated and free blocks, which introduces overhead and can lead to fragmentation.

>>>>>>>>>>Access Speed:

---------Stack: Accessing data on the stack is generally faster because it involves simple pointer arithmetic. The stack pointer is adjusted to
allocate or deallocate memory, and access to stack variables is usually cache-friendly because stack frames are often contiguous.
---------Heap: Accessing data on the heap can be slower due to the potential for fragmentation and non-contiguous memory blocks.
Additionally, the overhead of managing free memory blocks and metadata can impact performance.

>>>>>>>>>Lifetime and Scope:

---------Stack: Variables on the stack have a well-defined scope and lifetime tied to function calls. This makes stack memory management
straightforward and fast.
---------Heap: Variables on the heap have a dynamic lifetime. They need to be explicitly managed, which adds overhead. If not managed properly,
heap memory can lead to memory leaks or fragmentation.






so in simple words allocating memory on the heap is an hole another thing where allocating memory on the stack is just one cpu instruction
i have said one cpu instruction because the memory from stack fits on one cache line of the cpu where in case of heap it fits in multiple
cache lines
