/*
The `inline` keyword in C++ is used to suggest to the compiler that it should attempt to inline a function. Inlining a
function means that the compiler replaces the function call with the actual function code, potentially improving performance
by eliminating the overhead of a function call. However, the compiler may choose to ignore this suggestion based on various factors,
such as function complexity and optimization settings.

Simple Functions: Small and simple functions are more likely to be inlined. For instance, a function with a single return statement
or a few lines of code is a good candidate for inlining.
Complex Functions: Functions with complex control flow (e.g., loops, conditionals, recursion) or large amounts of code may not be
inlined because inlining them can lead to code bloat and degrade performance.


Compiler Flags: Compilers have optimization levels that affect inlining. For example, with optimization flags like -O2 or -O3, 
the compiler is more aggressive in applying optimizations, including inlining.
No Optimization: If you compile with no optimization flags (e.g., -O0), the compiler may not inline functions as it focuses on 
retaining the original code structure.

### Detailed Explanation of `inline`

1. **Purpose of `inline`**:

   - **Reduce Function Call Overhead**: By inlining functions, the overhead of calling a function (such as pushing arguments onto 
   the stack and jumping to the function code) is reduced.
   - **Increase Performance**: For small, frequently called functions, inlining can improve performance by avoiding the function 
   call overhead.

2. **Syntax**:

   The `inline` keyword is used in the function declaration and definition.

   **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   inline void myFunction();
   ```

   **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   inline void myFunction() {
       // Function implementation
   }
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   inline int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `add` function is small and simple. The compiler may choose to inline this function, replacing calls to `add`
    with the code `a + b`.

3. **How Inlining Works**:

   - **Function Call Replacement**: When the compiler inlines a function, it replaces calls to that function with the function's code.
   - **Optimization**: Inlining can lead to performance improvements, especially in tight loops or performance-critical code, 
    by avoiding the overhead associated with function calls.

4. **When to Use `inline`**:

   - **Small, Simple Functions**: Best used for small functions where the overhead of the function call is significant relative 
   to the function's execution time.
   - **Frequently Called Functions**: Functions that are called frequently can benefit from inlining.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   inline int square(int x) {
       return x * x;
   }
   ```

   - **Header Files**: Functions defined in header files are often declared `inline` to avoid multiple definition errors
    during linking when included in multiple translation units
    Problem: When a function is defined in a header file and included in multiple translation units, it results in multiple 
    definitions, causing linker errors

    Solution: Use inline to indicate that multiple definitions of the same function in different translation units are allowed.
    The inline keyword informs the compiler that the function can be defined in multiple places but should be treated as a single
    entity during linking.The linker recognizes that these definitions are identical and handles them correctly without errors.

5. **Limitations and Considerations**:

   - **Function Complexity**: The compiler might ignore the `inline` request for complex functions because inlining large
    functions can increase the size of the compiled code (code bloat).
   - **Debugging**: Inline functions may make debugging more difficult because the function call is replaced by the function
    code in the generated assembly.
   - **Recursion**: Inline functions should not be recursive or have complex control flow, as this can prevent effective inlining.

6. **Inline Variables (C++17 and Later)**:

   C++17 introduced the concept of inline variables, allowing variables to have internal linkage and be defined in header files
    without violating the One Definition Rule (ODR).

   **Syntax**:
   ```cpp
   inline int globalVar = 0;
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   // header.h
   inline int counter = 0;

   // main.cpp
   #include "header.h"
   int main() {
       counter++;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   Here, `counter` can be defined in multiple translation units, but it is treated as a single entity.

7. **Inline Functions and Templates**:

   - **Templates**: When defining template functions, the `inline` keyword is often used to ensure that the function definitions
    are available in all translation units that use the template. This is because templates are instantiated in each translation
    unit where they are used.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   inline T max(T a, T b) {
       return (a > b) ? a : b;
   }
   ```

   - **Header Files**: This function can be defined in a header file and used in multiple translation units without causing multiple
    definition errors.  for templetes you donot have to explicitlly use inline it is impilicitlly used

### Summary

- **Purpose**: `inline` suggests that the compiler replace function calls with the function code to reduce overhead.
- **Usage**: Best for small, frequently called functions.
- **Limitations**: The compiler may ignore the `inline` request based on complexity; inlining large functions can increase code size.
- **Inline Variables**: Introduced in C++17 for defining variables with internal linkage in header files.
- **Templates**: `inline` is useful for ensuring template functions are available in all translation units.

Overall, while `inline` can optimize performance, modern compilers often have sophisticated optimization algorithms that make explicit use of 
`inline` less critical than it once was. However, it remains a useful tool in certain situations, especially in header files and for simple functions.
