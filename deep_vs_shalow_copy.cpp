/*
note that the concept of shallow copy and deep copy is only in the dynamically allocated variables it is not applicable on the static 
variables as there is always deep copy in  the static variable but dnamically allocated variables are ristricted to both deep and shallow copy

this is because of the pointers because the dynamic variables/objects always use pointers
it is due to the address when two pointers share one address shallow copy happends and when each pointer point to seprate address then deep 
copy happends 
so whether it is dynamic variable or static it is the pointer that cause this problem so when dealing with pointer you should always 
use precausions

if you are copying any class obj which has an pointer as an member so you need to define an copy constructor or an assignment oprator
that do deep copy of the pointer
otherwize shallow copy will occur and will cause problem
