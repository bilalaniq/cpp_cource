// -----------------------------------arrow oprator-----------------------
/*
the arrow operator (->) is used to access members of a class or structure that is referenced by a pointer. It is essentially
a shorthand notation for accessing members through a pointer.
When you have a pointer to an object, you can use the arrow operator to access members of that object directly through the pointer.
The arrow operator is used in conjunction with a pointer to an object. It dereferences the pointer and accesses the
member of the object being pointed to
The arrow operator is typically used when you have a pointer to an object and want to access members of that object without
explicitly dereferencing the pointer

    // ptr.data    error!!!      correct way is
    // (*ptr).printData();    remember that you got to first derefrence the pointer in the bracket because the . oprator has more precitence then *
    //you could store the derefrence of the pointer in an refrence like
    //  MyClass& ref = *ptr;
    //  now you cold call using this rerence like this
